Exercise 6 : H2G2 Parser

There are a few ways to do this 

The disssect part of the Filter portion looks like this:

filter {
   # dissect parser
   dissect {
      mapping => {
        'message' => '%{source} - "%{quote}"'
      }
   }


Add a key:values based on a field value 
    This would also go into the Filter section

   # set Arthur's attributes
   if [source] == "arthur" {
     mutate {
        add_field => [ "home_planet", "earth" ]
        add_field => [ "occupation", "radio" ]
     }
   }
