Searches are entered on the Search/Query bar in the Kibana Discover tab
Results returned are based on the search results and the time period selection
    NOTE - Visualizations and Dashboards are also reflective of the time period
Searches are not case sensitive

The main thing to notice is the number of hits returned and what is highlighted

Search Types
    Use the Chicago Crime index for the examples

Free Text search
    Type anything in the search bar
    Any match in any filed will be returned
    Example - small retail store
    
Term search is a word
    Example - retail
    
Phrase search is a phrase that must be matched denoted by enclosing in double quotes
    Example (not a phrase)
        SMALL RETAIL STORE (note the number of hits ~19K)
    Example (phrase)
        "SMALL RETAIL STORE" (note the number of hits ~7K)

Field searches
    Fields are access using the syntac fieldName: search value
    NOTE: Many key names are similar like WARD and WARD.keyword. Either can be used in a search
    NOTE: Field names must be capatilized
    Examples 
        WARD:42
        WARD.keyword: 42 (space between them will work but you should be consisent)
           
Wildcards
    Wildcards, represented by an *,  can be used
    NOTE - These are computationally expensive, use with care
    Example - P*

Logical Operators
    AND and OR (must be uppercase). Tey can be used on their own or combined (like a math equation)
    Simple Examples
        small OR retail OR store
        small AND retail AND store (the hits being the same as the phrase search is a limitation of the data set)
        "small retail store" NOT WARD:42
    Complex
        "small retail store" NOT (WARD:42 OR WARD:8 OR ward:14)
    
MUST MATCH (+) and MUST NOT MATCH (-)
    + and - mean the term or phrase must be found or must not be found
    Examples
        small +retail +store - Must have 'retail and 'store' can may have small
        +small +retail +store - Logically the same as "small retail store"

Range searches
    Syntax (where val1 is the start and val2 is the end)
    NOTE - Exclusive only seems to work on certain fields
        Works on Ward, not on Primary/Secondary Descriptions, both are string types but Ward is a number
        
    Inclusive uses []
        FILEDNAME: [val1 TO val2]
        Example
            PRIMARY_DESCRIPTION:[B TO D]
  
    Exclusive uses {}
        FILEDNAME: {val1 TO val2}
        Example
            PRIMARY_DESCRIPTION:{B TO D}

Regex
NOTE - Regex's are computationally expensive, only use them when you have to
    uses the ? to denotes zero or one match
    Example - SECONDARY_DESCRIPTION:C?r*
    Matches CREDIT CARD FRAUD, ILLEGAL USE CASH CARD, ABUSE/NEGLECT: CARE FACILITY, etc
