Dissect Filters

What they do - Parses unstructured event data into structured data.

How they do it - Extracts data into fields using delimiters or what separates the values

Why it is useful - You can build a parser for most event patterns.

About the conf file - Parses the access_5.log in sample logs and outputs to the console

Other Info:
Because dissect does not use RegEx it is much less resource and can be less error prone for log formats that change
