Realized I need to do a Logstash 101 page after learning some things putting together training for BSides Austin. The goal is to introduce how to do Logstash from a command line, troubleshooting 101, and some guidance on some of the more useful plugins and codecs.

Getting Started - exactly what it says, start here.  
Tips and tricks - Things that will help when working on Logstash conf files  
VarLogMessages.conf - parser for /var/log/messages. Using it for the [Python Elasticsearch libraries](https://github.com/macatak/ELK/tree/master/Python-Elasticsearch-API)
