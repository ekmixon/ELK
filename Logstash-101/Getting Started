You do not need to install Logstash to learn it. Just download the GZ or ZIP file and extract the contents.I have yet to hit any version issues so just go gret the latest version. You can download the file of your choice here:  
https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash  

Provided examples will used the installed version with the following default paths:  
Executable - /usr/share/logstash/bin/  
Sample logs - /home/bikeride/log_samples/
Conf files - /etc/logstash/conf_files  

You will have to update your paths accordingly


Conf file syntax check  
This will check the syntax only of the file, it does not mean it will work as expected  

  Syntax  
  /usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash -f <conf file> -t  
  
  Example  
  /usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash -f /etc/logstash/conf_files/grok_101.conf -t

It does take a few seconds to run. There will be some warnings that yo can ignore.  
The output we care about is at the bottom. 
Pass  
  Configuration OK  
  [INFO ] 2019-04-06 16:43:18.590 [LogStash::Runner] runner - Using config.test_and_exit mode. Config Validation Result: OK. Exiting Logstash  
Fail example  
  [FATAL] 2019-04-06 16:48:32.808 [LogStash::Runner] runner - The given configuration is invalid. Reason: Expected one of #, => at line 11, column 9 (byte 193) after input {  


Running from a command line  
The syntax is the same, just remove the '-t' from the end  
  Syntax  
  /usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash -f <conf file>
  
  Example  
  /usr/share/logstash/bin/logstash -f /etc/logstash/conf_files/grok_101.conf
