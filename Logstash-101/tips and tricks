Most syntax errors are due to missing curly braces. I recommend using the Atom IDE available here:  
https://atom.io/  

Install the Logstash (and Elasticsearch while you are doing it) package. Atom will autocomplete closing braces and other things for you. It will help a lot in this area because large conf files can are not a lot of fun to troubleshoot.  

No output from Logstash usually means no input. Whether the input is a file (check the path), Beat (make sure it's running) or other feed.  

Developing conf files  
Using the file input and stdout output is the best way to go when devloping conf files. See the examples in this repo.  
The only real requirement is the sample log file you are using contains all the different log entry formats that you will see coming in.  

Break your conf files up into smaller ones and number them with the inputs being firsts, filters second, and outputs last.  
Examples:  
  100-beat_input.conf
  101-syslog_input.conf
  200-apache_access.conf
  201-weblogic.conf
  300-stdout_output.conf
  301-elastichsearch_output.conf  
  
In the real world this will make life much easier on a number of levels.
